![My Desktop](assets/kdelook.png)

I like my mess of a desktop. This repo is where I keep the config. I like to have a hybrid floating
and stacking workflow in my desktop environment. [COSMIC](https://system76.com/cosmic/) could be my
dream desktop but I can't justify using something still in alpha, so I'm sticking with
[KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/). What about [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/)? I just
don't like its uncompromising nature.

My terminal's Oh My Posh theme: [nyxcat.omp.toml](nyxcat.omp.toml)
